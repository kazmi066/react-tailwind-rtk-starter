Starting off a React project with no baseline can be a hassle. Most project require the same initial structure and libraries so we created a template where you can easily start a new React project.
`create-react-app` might give you a barebones template of how to start but our template aims at accelerating the process further by giving you all the tools you need to develop powerful web apps.

This is an Open Source project maintained by the Stellar Minore team.

## Instructions on using this template

On creating a new project, please update these things:

1. Change project title in public/index.html
2. Update website meta description in public/index.html
3. Replace project favicon asset with project favicon in public folder
